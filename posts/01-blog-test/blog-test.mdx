Whether you are new to programming or already an experienced developer. In this industry, learning new concepts and languages/frameworks is
mandatory to keep up with the rapid changes. Take for example React - open-sourced by Facebook just a shy 4 years ago it already became the number one choice for JavaScript devs around the globe. But also Vue and Angular, of course, have their legitimate follower-base. And then there is

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Test() {
  return (
    <div>
      <button className="rounded-lg py-2 px-4 transition bg-blue-500 focus:outline-none active:bg-blue-800">
        Click Me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<button className="rounded-lg py-2 px-4 transition bg-blue-500 focus:outline-none active:bg-blue-800">
  Click Me
</button>

You can use `sudo apt install python3` to install Python 3 on Ubuntu.
