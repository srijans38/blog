Whether you are new to programming or already an experienced developer. In this industry, learning new concepts and languages/frameworks is
mandatory to keep up with the rapid changes. Take for example React - open-sourced by Facebook just a shy 4 years ago it already became the number one choice for JavaScript devs around the globe. But also Vue and Angular, of course, have their legitimate follower-base. And then there is

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Test() {
  return <div></div>;
}
```

**This is Bold**

`sudo apt get python3`
