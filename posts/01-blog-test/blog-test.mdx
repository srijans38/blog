import { useState } from 'react';

This is a test post. The image is of a cat because it's the internet and internet loves cat.

Here's a Code Snippet

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Test() {
  return (
    <div>
      <button className="rounded-lg py-2 px-4 transition bg-blue-500 focus:outline-none active:bg-blue-800">
        Click Me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here's a React Component inside mdx. Click the button! He's asking for it.

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setCount(count + 1);
        }}
        className="rounded-lg py-2 px-4 transition bg-blue-500 focus:outline-none active:bg-blue-800"
      >
        Click Me
      </button>
    </>
  );
};

<Counter />
